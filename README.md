## Introduction

Git is an essential tool for modern software development. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your code efficiently. This repository will guide you through the fundamental Git commands you need to know.

## Getting Started

To start using Git, you need to have it installed on your machine. You can download and install Git from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

After installing Git, configure it with your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
